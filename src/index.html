                  <h4>Shot June 10, 2017 by Auburn police</h4>
                  <p>Obet, 25 was shot and killed by Auburn Police Officer Jeffrey Nelson on June 10, 2017, who was responding to a call of a man acting strangely, possibly armed with a small knife.  Nelson confronted Obet, where Nelson said the man ran from him and tried to open the door of a nearby vehicle. Nelson, a K-9 officer, released his dog, which attacked Obet. Nelson then shot Obet twice, once in the chest and once in the head. The city settled a lawsuit filed by the family for $1.25 million after Nelson, an officer, with an extensive history of using force, was charged with the murder of Jesse Sarey last year.</p>
