                  <h2>Damarius Butts</h2>
                  <h4>Shot April 20, 2017, by Seattle police</h4>
                  <p>Butts was shot and killed by Seattle police following a report of an armed robbery at a downtown convenience store. Nineteen-year-old Butts and his 17-year-old sister reportedly stole doughnuts, chips and a 12-pack of beer, showing the clerk a handgun on the way out. Officers gave chase and cornered him at the downtown Federal Office Building, where gunshots were exchanged. A police officer was struck in the protective vest with a round. Butts suffered multiple gunshot wounds.</p>

                  <h4>Shot June 10, 2017, by Auburn police</h4>
                  <p>Obet, 25, was shot and killed by Auburn police Officer Jeffrey Nelson, who was responding to a call of a man acting strangely and possibly armed with a small knife. Nelson said when he confronted Obet, the man ran and tried to open the door of a nearby vehicle. Nelson, a K-9 officer, released his dog, which attacked Obet. Nelson then shot Obet twice, once in the chest and once in the head. Last year, the city settled a lawsuit brought by the family for $1.25 million. Shortly after, it was announced that Nelson, who has an extensive history of using force, was charged with murder in the death of Jesse Sarey.</p>
